Project Ideas
-------------

### Machine Learning
* Custom classifiers for most common non-equation image types in Math/Sci Textbooks (should we provide ML hw? Azure $?)
* Custom OCR processes for most common non-equation image types in Math/Sci Textbooks (should we provide ML hw? Azure $?)
### Javascript(React?)/HTML/CSS
* Frontend for human remediation (Would need access to MD assets in BKS AWS account, setup accounts ahead of time?)
### Python, Java, Node.js, Go (Any Lambda runtime but Python preferred)
* Modify and/or re-implement the [Math Detective XhtmlImageReplacer](https://github.com/benetech/XhtmlImageReplacer) as an [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function (would need to run in BKS AWS account, setup accounts ahead of time?)
